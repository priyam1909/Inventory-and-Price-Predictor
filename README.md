## Inventory-and-Price-Predictor

It includes table column names and a hypothetical Copilot screen for interactive assistance.

---

**Step 1: Define the Data Model**
Start by defining the data model for your app. We'll create a table named `GroceryInventory` with the following columns:

- **ProductID (AutoNumber):** Unique identifier for each product.
- **ProductName (Text):** Name of the grocery item.
- **Category (Choice):** Category to which the product belongs (Vegetables, Fruits, Dairy, etc.).
- **QuantityInStock (Number):** Current stock level of the item.
- **Price (Currency):** Current price of the item.

**Step 2: Set Up Your Data Source**
Connect your Power App to a data source (e.g., SharePoint, SQL Server). Create a connection to the `GroceryInventory` table.

**Step 3: Design the App Interface**
Design the main screens: Inventory Screen and Price Prediction Screen.

**Step 4: Create Inventory Screen**
1. **Gallery Control:** Use a Gallery control to display the list of groceries.
2. **Data Connection:** Connect the Gallery to your data source (GroceryInventory).
3. **Columns in Gallery:** Display columns such as ProductName, Category, QuantityInStock, and Price.

**Step 5: Create Price Prediction Screen**
1. **Input Control:** Use a Text Input or Dropdown to allow users to select a product.
2. **Button Control:** Add a button to trigger the price prediction.
3. **Copilot Chat Screen:** Create a screen where users can interact with Copilot for assistance and questions related to the app.

**Step 6: Implement Actions**
1. **Add New Product:** Create a form for adding new products to the inventory.
2. **Update Price:** Implement functionality to update prices.

**Step 7: Add Additional Features**
1. **Graphs/Charts:** Visualize inventory trends or price trends.
2. **Notifications:** Implement alerts for low stock levels.
3. **User Authentication:** Add user authentication to secure the app.

**Step 8: Test and Refine**
Test the app thoroughly, checking for data accuracy, usability, and responsiveness.

**Step 9: Copilot Interaction Screen**
Create a Copilot Interaction screen where users can ask questions and seek assistance. Copilot can help with generating formulas, suggesting code snippets, and providing guidance on app development-related queries.

**Step 10: Deployment**
Once satisfied with testing, deploy the app to environment.
